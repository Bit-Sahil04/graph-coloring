# graph-coloring
A simple program to visualize greedy graph coloring algorithm<br>
Only requires pygame 2.0<br>


The controls are a bit weird but anyway:<br>
``Down`` Generate a random graph <br>
``Up`` Decrease the max number of nodes <br>
``Right`` Increase max number of nodes <br>
``Left`` Color nodes sequentially
